The html and css has been laid out for you.  You just have to make the green button work

The current html file has static data that is placeholder data.  Replace the static data with dynamic data that comes from the api calls.  

- clone the following github repository:  
    - https://github.com/veros-labs/js-lab-api-random-user-generator
- make a call to the api: https://randomuser.me/api/
- every time a call is made to this api, new data for a random user is generated
    - try it!  Put the api url in your browser window.  Every time you refresh the page, new data is generated. 
- use this data to display the following information for the user:
    - name
    - profile picture
    - username
    - email
    - city
