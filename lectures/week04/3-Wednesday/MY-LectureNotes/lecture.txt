Document Object Model (DOM) = JS lives inside browser and can be used to manipulate the DOM.

The document is one giant object and all the elements inside of it are called NODES.  Some meta and high-level elements (body, title, URL, etc) are properties of the document and can be retrieved using dot notation.
