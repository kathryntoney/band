## Balanced Brackets

Write a function that takes inba string made up of brackets ( `(`, `[`, `{`, `}`, `]`, and `}`) and other optional characters.  

**The function should return a boolean representing whether the string is balanced with regards to brackets.** 

A string is said to be balanced if it has as many opening brackets of a certain type as it has closing brackets of that type and if no bracket is unmatched.  

**Note** that an opening bracket can't match a corresponding closing bracket that comes before it, and similarly, a closing bracket can't match a corresponding opening bracket that comes after it.  Also, brackets can't overlap each other as in `[(])`. ]
